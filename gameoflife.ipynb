    "The Game of Life, also known as Conways' Game of Life, is a cellular automaton game invented by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game is played on a grid of cells, each of which can be either dead or alive. The state of each cell is determined by its neighbors according to a set of rules. At each step in the game, the state of each cell is updated based on the state of its neighbors in the previous step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The game is known for its ability to generate complex and seemingly intelligent behavior from a simple set of rules. It has been used as a model for understanding complex systems in fields such as biology, economics, and social science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life has been the subject of much research and fascination, and it continues to be a popular topic in computer science and mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will render a random initial configuration to see how one half of the window incubates and spreads living cells into the rest of the window. "
